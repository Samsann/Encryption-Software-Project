Encryption Software using C++ and Web Development

This project is a simple encryption application that integrates a C++ backend for encryption and decryption with a web interface for user interaction. The project uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for encryption and decryption, demonstrating how to bridge C++ applications with web technologies.

Features
AES Encryption and Decryption: Uses OpenSSL library in C++ to perform AES encryption and decryption.
Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interacting with the encryption and decryption functionalities.
Flask Backend: A Flask server to handle HTTP requests and communicate with the C++ encryption binary.

Requirements
C++ Compiler: GCC, MSVC, or any other standard C++ compiler.
OpenSSL Library: For handling encryption algorithms.
Python: For running the Flask server.
Flask: Python micro web framework.
